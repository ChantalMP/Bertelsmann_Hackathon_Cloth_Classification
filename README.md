# Bertelsmann_Hackathon_Cloth_Classification
Backend for the robot Pepper to turn him into a fashion advisor.

Recommendation:
You tell pepper what you want (business cloth, make sport or just casual cloth) and he will show you suiting suggestions as pictures.

Advice:
Again you tell Pepper where you want to go. Now he will take a photo and send it to the backend. Here this photo gets classified with image recognition. Now Pepper can tell you if your clothing suits the event you want to participate in. He also is able to react due to your gender.

Used Tools: Microsoft Azure Custom Vision Service and Face Recognition
